            <h2 class="story">The Top Producers of 2021 According to Hip-hop Magazine XXL</h2>
            <p> While the big dogs like Metro Boomin, Murda Beatz, and Hit-Boy kept doing their thing in 2021, Youtube stars like TnTXD and Ant Chamberlain showed the community that Youtube producers can be just as successful as industry producers.</p>
            <figure>

            </figure>
            <h4>Metro Boomin</h4>
            <p>Everything Metro Boomin touches turns to fire. Recently, he’s part responsible for cuts like “Knife Talk” by Drake, “Love You More” by Young Thug plus “Burn” by Juice Wrld. "It feels jus like yesterday we recorded this intro at the house @juicewrld999 #FightingDemons out now RIP kid the world love u," Metro wrote in an Instagram post celebrating the posthumous release of their track "Burn." Metro pays it forward to the next generation, too, co-conducting additional songs like Don Toliver’s “Swangin’ on Westheimer” and Nardo Wick’s “Wickman.”</p>
            <h4>Wheezy</h4>
            <p>Almost every prized rap imprint has a go-to sound curator and for YSL, that person is Wheezy. In 2021, the lauded musician helped five albums reach No. 1 status on the Billboard 200 chart with his contributions to tracks on each: Slime Language 2 by his homegrown collective (“Ski”), Punk by Young Thug (“Bubbly”), Hall of Fame by Polo G (“Losses”), The Voice of the Heroes by Lil Baby and Lil Durk (“Who I Want”), plus Donda by Kanye West (“Jonah”). Only a fool would argue that his name isn’t up there with the greats.</p>

            </figure>
            <h4>DY Krazy</h4>
            <p>DY Krazy fuses the genres of gospel, R&B and Chicago juke music every time he makes a beat. His varied palette for creating sounds was applied this year on Lil Baby and EST Gee’s “Real As It Gets,” King Combs' Future-assisted “Holdin Me Down” and “Water Works” by Yung Bleu and Gunna, just to name a few. Notably, the 808 Mafia member reached further out West and helped the BlueBucksClan chin check their competitors with “Rap City,” showing that no style is out of his range.</p>
            <h4>TnTXD</h4>
            <p>One thing about TnTXD: he’s coming with that fire each and every time he’s behind the boards. His ability to spark a melodic ascension into the heavenly clouds of sound was proven this year on nearly half of Rod Wave’s chart-topping effort SoulFly. “Street Runner” went up enough to leave that statement there, but TNT also popped off with additional contributions to Lil Tjay’s “Headshot,” YoungBoy Never Broke Again’s “Nevada” and Pop Smoke’s “Back Door,” among plenty of others. Going crazy would be an understatement.</p>

            <h4>Enrgy Beats</h4>
            <p>Enrgy Beats came out swinging and already has a number of home runs to his name. After making the beats for breakthrough records for YN Jay with “Coochie” and Bfb Da Packman's “Free Joe Exotic," Enrgy helped rising street poet EST Gee make his presence felt by lacing a Hot Boys-esque foundation on “5500 Degrees.” Lending a hand to other acts, Enrgy Beats also secured production credits on Lil Yachty’s Motor City salute Michigan Boy Boat (“Concrete Goonies”) and Drakeo The Ruler’s Ain’t That The Truth (“Chops Out”). Nonetheless, the producer brings the ruckus with each rhythm he coats.</p>
            <h4>ATL Jacob</h4>
            <p>ATL Jacob, Future’s evolving right-hand producer, started 2021 off by offering his stylistics on “Real As It Gets” by Lil Baby and EST Gee, plus “Bruised Up” and “Lying” off Baby and Lil Durk’s No. 1 joint album, The Voice of the Heroes. He also helped newcomers like Kalii (“Mmm Mmm”) and Slimelife Shawty (“Baby Boy”) increase the clout around their names. Most importantly, Jacob helped Kodak Black score his latest hit with “Super Gremlin,” a song that has since erupted more than a bottle of Coca-Cola with a handful of Mentos dropped into it.</p>

            <h4>Hit-Boy</h4>
            <p>Hit-Boy has soared so high in 2021 that he’ll need a parachute to come back down. The seasoned hit-generator put in work on the sequel to Nas’ Grammy award-winning King’s Disease effort, and helped Big Sean tote the definitive sound of Detroit on the short but potent What You Expect. Taking things even further, Hit-Boy also crafted gems with Cordae (“Sinister”) and Maxo Kream (“Greener Knots”). Like Hit spits on “Composure,” "We know the caged bird sings and screams when it’s free," as he has been with a revived run over the last few years.</p>
            <h4>Jetsonmade</h4>
            <p>Jetsonmade surged to the top 10 of the Billboard charts with DaBaby's "Suge” last year, and now, the 23-year-old producer found his way back toward the top again with co-production on Jack Harlow’s “Whats Poppin.” If that song (which peaked at No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100)  and its remix (which features Lil Wayne, Tory Lanez and DaBaby), didn’t convince you, perhaps it's his co-production on J. Cole’s “Lion King On Ice” or Playboi Carti’s “@ Meh” that will do the trick.</p>

                  <p>
                     Melody loops have been a stable part of hip-hop production in the past decade. However, various complications can arise from royalty splits and publishing rights.
